** Prerequisites
- Install git
- Create a github account
- Optional:
  - Install gitKraken(https://www.gitkraken.com/) as a nice to have interface over git
  - Install VSCode(https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing HTML, CSS, and site templates
    
** Setting Up Git
Git allows you to track changes to your files and push those changes to remote hosts, github in this case.

*** Generating your ssh key
In order for you to push, you'll first need to create an SSH key and attach it to your github account[fn:1]

In a command prompt, run the following:
#+begin_src shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
#+end_src

Just hit enter and accept the defaults for all the prompts.

*** Adding your ssh key to your github account
- Go to your github profile settings
- select /SSH and GPG keys/ on the left-hand side bar
- Select /New SSH key/
- Give your key a title and copy the contents of the =.pub= file that was generated in the last step with =ssh-keygen=.
  - *DO NOT* copy the contents of the file without an exception. That is your private key secret and you should /NEVER/ share it with anyone or they'll be able to push to your github account!

You should now be good to go!

*** Create your repo and verify you have access
Create a repository in github, following most of the defaults, but uncheck /initialize with readme/.

From shell, run the following:
#+begin_src shell :eval never
touch README.md
git add README.md 
git commit -m "init"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin git@github.com:{YOUR REPO NAME HERE}.git
git push -u origin master
#+end_src

Verify that =README.md= is present in your repo.

** Setting Up The Site
On your website's repository:
- Go to settings
- From the sidebar select /Pages/
- Scroll to /branch/ and select =master=.
- Click save
- Navigate to ={YOUR GITHUB USERNAME}.github.io/{YOUR REPO NAME}= to see your site.
