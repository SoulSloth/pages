It's relatively simple to get setup with your own web site with Github Pages.

** Prerequisites
- Install git(https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Create a github account(https://github.com/)
- Optional:
  - Install gitKraken(https://www.gitkraken.com/) as a nice to have interface over git
  - Install VSCode(https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing HTML, CSS, and site templates
    
** Setting Up Git
Git allows you to track changes to your files and push those changes to remote hosts, github in this case.

*** Generating your ssh key
In order for you to push, you'll first need to create an SSH key and attach it to your github account[fn:1]

In a terminal, run the following:
#+begin_src shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
#+end_src

Just hit enter and accept the defaults for all the prompts. This will generate a private and public key for you to authorize actions on your github repositories.

*** Adding your ssh key to your github account
- Go to your github profile settings
- select /SSH and GPG keys/ on the left-hand side bar
 [[./pics/ssh-settings.png]]
- Select /New SSH key/
  [[./pics/new-ssh-key.png]]
- Give your key a title and copy the contents of the =.pub= file that was generated in the last step with =ssh-keygen=.
  - *DO NOT* copy the contents of the file without an exception. That is your private key secret and you should /NEVER/ share it with anyone or they'll be able to push to your github account!

You should now be good to go!

*** Create your repo and verify you have access
Create a repository in github, following most of the defaults, but uncheck /initialize with readme/.

From shell, in a new directory, run the following:
#+begin_src shell :eval never
touch README.md
git add README.md 
git commit -m "init"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin git@github.com:{YOUR REPO NAME HERE}.git
git push -u origin master
#+end_src

Verify that =README.md= is present in your repo.

** Setting Up The Site
Run the following commands in your project folder:
#+begin_src shell
echo "Hello!" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "created a home page"
git push origin master
#+end_src

On your website's repository:
- Go to settings
- From the side-bar select /Pages/
- Scroll to /branch/ and select =master=.
- Click save
- Navigate to ={YOUR GITHUB USERNAME}.github.io/{YOUR REPO NAME}= to see your site.

*** Changes To My Site Aren't Showing Up!
On your repo page, click on the status icon that appears in the most recent commit bar:
[[./pics/status-icon.png]]

It might be that your site is still being built and deployed or there's an issue with your site that needs to be fixed.
